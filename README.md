# Odin Recipes

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum and is aimed at demonstrating my skills in HTML and CSS. I will be creating a simple recipe website that showcases various recipes with a focus on structuring the HTML and applying CSS to make the site visually appealing. Throughout the project, I will also learn about version control using Git and GitHub to manage the codebase.
